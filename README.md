## UB Loyalty

UB Loyalty is a digital rewards platform, built for small businesses. This project was built for CSE611 - Fall 19 under the guidance of [Alan Hunt](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/ahunt/), [Ethan Blanton](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~eblanton/).

The project is no longer being maintained and the contents of this repository is the v0.1 of the project that we ended up submitting. I am not releasing the final version here, as we are not allowed to do so. 

The project was a team effort. More details can be found [here](https://odin.cse.buffalo.edu/demoday/2019fa.html) under *17*. This project also won the 2nd place under the projects category.
